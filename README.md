# Public API Auth Provider

Inspired by: https://hackernoon.com/improve-the-security-of-api-keys-v5kp3wdu

## Usage

Define your own `challenge.sh` & `response.sh` and mount them into the docker image.

- Make sure to provide a randomly unique challenge on every execution of the `challenge.sh`.
- Make sure to implement the `response.sh` to generate a deterministic response on each given input generated by the `challenge.sh`

Define an API-Key and provide it in the environement variables of the docker image.

## Docker

```bash
# build
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t authprovider .
# run
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/path/to/your/own/scripts/folder:/service/scripts -e API_KEY=your-api-key authprovider
```

## Known Limitations

- clustering currently not possible  
  will be possible in the future with redis integration
